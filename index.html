    <h1>"My High School Experience"</h1>
    <p>Today I asked my teacher to go to the bathroom, so he put down the chalk, turned towards the door and stepped out into the hallway. When I curiously looked to see where he was going, he was headed right to the bathroom. I went to the front of the class, to everyone's surprise, and blurted out: "That's not what I meant! He just totally went to the bathroom!"</p>
    <p>"You mean the teacher will actually do what we say?!?!?!?" One curious boy with round glasses and triangular, plaid, neon purple pants said aloud.</p>
